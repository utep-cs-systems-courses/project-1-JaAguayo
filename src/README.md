Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
This directory contains source code for the program "tokenizer."
Tokenizer takes a user inputed string and creates tokens of each word as well
as stores each string in history for the user to access whichever individual
string based on id or access all of the history that the user has inputted.

You can run the progrm by using the command "make" then using "./tokenizer"
and then the user will be prompted to enter a string.
